Ensure that any test city files are in the same folder as optSubmit.py.  You will also want watch.py in the same folder.

Implementation with watch.py is python watch.py python <program_name> <input file>, for example
python watch.py python optSubmit.py tsp_example_2.txt will run optSubmit.py with watch.py on tsp_example_2.txt.

All output is in the format of <input file>.tour, so tsp_example_2.txt will output tsp_example_2.txt.tour.
